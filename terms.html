  <h1>  <p>ðŸ“„ Application Terms â€“ Please Read Before Submitting<br></h1>
Before you apply to join our amateur CS2 team, please carefully read the following terms and expectations. By submitting this application, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the following conditions:<br><br>

<strong>Minimum Weekly Commitment<br></strong>
All applicants must be available to dedicate at least 25 hours per week to team activities. This includes scrims, matches, individual practice, and team meetings. Consistency and dedication are key to our improvement and performance.<br><br>

<strong>Age Requirement<br></strong>
Applicants must be between 14 and 17 years old. We are building a youth-oriented team with similar maturity levels and time availability.<br><br>

<strong>Communication Is Key<br></strong>
You must have a working microphone and be willing to communicate actively during practices and matches. Hungarian is our main language for all in-game and team discussions, so a basic ability to speak and understand Hungarian is required.<br><br>

<strong>Amateur â€“ But Serious<br></strong>
While we are an amateur team, we take our development seriously. We are looking for players who are motivated, disciplined, and committed to growth â€” both as individuals and as a team. This is not a casual group; this is a place to improve and compete.<br><br>

<strong>Long-Term Mindset<br></strong>
Weâ€™re not here for one tournament and done. We're building something for the long run. If you're only looking for a short-term team, this might not be the right place for you. Please apply only if youâ€™re planning to stick with the team long-term.<br><br>

<strong>Respect and Team Spirit<br></strong>
Toxicity, trolling, or any form of disrespect will not be tolerated. We want to foster a positive and supportive environment where everyone feels welcome and motivated.<br>

If you agree with all of the above, feel free to complete the application form below. We look forward to learning more about you and potentially welcoming you to the team!</p><br><br><br>

<strong>Further information
After you submit your application, we will review it within 1 week, check your Steam profile, and if everything is in order, we will contact you on Discord.</strong><br>
